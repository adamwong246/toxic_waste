The creation of Science Packs also produce waste byproducts.

The making of a Science Pack will generate immense amounts waste of 2 types- solid Scrap and fluid Sludge. Each can be reduced into an infinitely potent form, "Toxic Waste" which emits pollution proportional to it's concentration.

## Toxic Waste

A new item has been introduced- Toxic Waste. It is unlike most items in the game, as a single unit of Toxic Waste has a "toxicity" level, representing all the Scrap and Sludge with which it was made. Toxic Waste constantly emits pollution into the air.

Toxic Waste emits pollution in 3 ways
1) Rapidly when destroyed
2) Slowly when left 'out in the open',
3) Zero when sequestered in an undamaged pollution-proof container.

Each increasing tier of research produces waste of increasing challenge.
1) Automation   - zero waste
2) Logistics    - zero waste
3) Military     - Scrap                         - Waste weapons
4) Chemical     - Sludge                        - Waste refinement
5) Production   - Scrap  + Toxic Waste          - Anti-Polluters and Polluters
6) Utility      - Sludge + Toxic Waste          - Waste Sequesters
7) Space        - Scrap  + Sludge + Toxic Waste

## Waste weapons

Toxic Waste has a single use- as a weapon that does zero damage, but spreads pollution. Scrap can be used to make Polluting missiles and Sludge can be used in a sludge-thrower. These weapons will antagonize biters and accelerate their evolution, while doing no damage at all.

## Waste refineries

2 new machines have been introduced- Scrap Compactors and Sludge Condensers. Each concentrate an infinite amount of waste units into Toxic Waste. Any non-waste product put into a waste refiner will be turned into more waste.

## Waste sequesters

A new storage container has been introduced- Waste Sequesters. These containers can contain the pollution emitted by Toxic Waste, but have very limited space of only a single grid space, have a large footprint but are are quite cheap.

## Polluters and Anti-Polluters

Two new machines has been added- the Polluter and the Anti-Polluter. Polluters accept waste and emit it into the air. Anti-Polluters act oppositely- they use electricity to scrub pollution out of the air, exporting it as only slightly hazardous Toxic Waste.

## Implementation

This mod is heavily based upon MemoryStorage. It makes some very select modifications.
- "Memory Elements" are now referred to as "Toxic Waste."
- "Memory Units" are now Scrap Compactors and Sludge Condensers. Anything placed within will instantly become more waste.

## Hints

You have 4 techniques for dealing with Toxic Waste:
- Refine it into a more concentrated form.
- Store it long term in sequesters.
- Release the pollution in a controlled way, using a Polluter or a Waste weapon
- A secret 4th strategy can be used to rid yourself of Toxic Waste, for a sky-high cost.

## Credits
Thanks to the devs of the Memory Storage mod, without whom this work would not be possible.
