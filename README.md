The creation of Science Packs also produces Toxic Waste.

The making of a Science Pack will generate Toxic Waste of 2 types- solid Scrap and fluid Sludge. Each type can be reduced into ever more potent forms, which while reducing the amount of pollution they emit naturally, magnify the consequences of a disaster. Scrap and Sludge are highly flammable and if ignited, will burn all the pollution as represented by their "toxicity". Fluids are especially dangerous- while Scrap is flammable, Sludge is explosive, sending out fireballs in all directions.

Toxic Waste is different from other items in the game- it constantly emits pollution constantly. You have 3 techniques for dealing with Toxic Waste:
- Refine the waste to make it more hazardous, but with a smaller footprint
- Store it long term in expensive pollution proof containers
- Release the pollution in a controlled way

Toxic Waste emits pollution in 3 ways
1) Rapidly when destroyed
2) Slowly when left 'out in the open',
3) Zero when sequestered in an undamaged pollution-proof container.

## Wastes
Item            | type  | flammable | explosive |
------------------------------------------------------------------
Scrap          | solid | y          | n
Sludge         | fluid | y          | n

Each increasing tier of research produces waste of increasing challenge.

1) Automation   - zero waste
2) Logistics    - zero waste
3) Military     - non-polluting Scrap
4) Chemical     - non-polluting Sludge       - introduce Polluters
5) Production   - polluting Scrap            - introduce Pollution-proof containers
6) Utility      - polluting Sludge           - introduce Refiners
7) Space        - polluting Scrap and Sludge - introduce Pollution weapons and safety-systems

## Toxicity

A new field has been introduced. Waste units now have a field "toxicity" that represents how the amount of pollution that would be released of that unit were to catch flame. Non-polluting scrap has a toxicity of 0.

## Waste Refineries

2 new machines have been introduced- Scrap Refiners and Sludge Refiners. Each takes 2 units of waste of their respective types and combines them into a single unit of waste with a summed toxicity + 1.

## Waste Containers

2 new storage mechanisms have been introduced- Scrap Containers and Sludge Storage Tanks. These containers are the slowest emitters of pollution, however, they have very limited space. If destroyed, they release all the Toxic Waste contained therein.

## Polluters

A new machine has been added- the Polluter. Polluters accept waste and emit it into the air in a controlled way. Because all Toxic Waste emits pollution continuously to some degree, it can be argued that the use of the Destructor is the most efficient way of disposing of waste. By promptly disposing of the waste, less pollution was emitted overall!

## Safety systems

Anti-fire foam can be used to extinguish toxic fires.

## Pollution weapons

Toxic Waste has a single use- as a weapon that does zero damage, but spreads pollution. Scrap can be used to make Polluting missiles and Sludge can be used in a sludge-thrower. These weapons will antagonize biters and accelerate their evolution, while doing no damage at all.

## FAQ

### Why have you introduced a new field "toxicity"?

Because it is also more UPS friendly and I wanted a mod that could be infinitely researched. Otherwise, I would have to resort to multiple forms of fuel and containers, something that cannot be infinite research cannot accommodate.

### This sounds hard. Do you have any hints?

There is a singular way of truly destroying Toxic Waste WITHOUT releasing into the air or storing it forever!
