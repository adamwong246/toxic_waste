# Toxic Waste
The production of Science Packs also produce waste byproducts.

## Design

### Scrap, Sludge and Toxic Waste

Three new items have been introduced- solid Scrap, fluid Sludge and concentrated Toxic Waste, which are byproducts of Science Pack production. Scrap and Sludge can be reduced into an infinitely potent form, "Toxic Waste". Toxic Waste is unlike most items in the game- a single unit of Toxic Waste represents all the Scrap and Sludge with which it was made. Toxic Waste emits pollution proportional to this concentration.

Toxic Waste emits pollution in 3 ways
1) Rapidly when destroyed
2) Slowly when left 'out in the open',
3) Zero when sequestered in an undamaged pollution-proof container.

### Waste refineries

2 new machines have been introduced- Scrap Compactors and Sludge Condensers. Each concentrate an infinite amount of Scrap or Sludge units into Toxic Waste. Any non-waste product put into a waste refiner will be turned into more waste.

### Waste sequestering methods

#### Toxic Chest
These containers can contain the pollution emitted by Toxic Waste, but have very limited space of only a single grid space, are modestly expensive and reusable.

#### Toxic Tomb
These buildings can contain the pollution emitted by Toxic Waste, but have very limited space of only a single grid space, have a very large footprint, are not expensive but permanent. If you damage a Toxic Tomb, the pollution will leak out. You can build these over contaminated soil.

#### Toxic Injector
The pumps can inject large amounts Toxic Waste into water quickly, where it will dissipate slowly. Landfilling will release the pollution.

#### Toxic Sequesterer
These act as reverse-mining machines which store Toxic Waste in the soil, where it will dissipate. You can build a Toxic Tomb over this contaminated land. Cementing over this soil will release the pollution.

#### Waste weapons

Toxic Waste has a single use- as a weapon that does zero damage, but spreads pollution. Scrap can be used to make Polluting missiles and Sludge can be used in a sludge-thrower. These weapons will antagonize biters and accelerate their evolution, while doing no damage at all.

### Polluters and Anti-Polluters

Polluters accept waste and emit it into the air as pollution. Anti-Polluters act oppositely- they use electricity to scrub pollution out of the air, exporting it as only slightly hazardous Toxic Waste.

### Technology and research

Each increasing tier of research produces waste of increasing challenge.
1) Automation   - zero waste
2) Logistics    - zero waste
3) Military     - Scrap                         - Waste weapons
4) Chemical     - Sludge                        - Waste refinement
5) Production   - Scrap  + Toxic Waste          - Anti-Polluters and Polluters
6) Utility      - Sludge + Toxic Waste          - Waste Sequesters
7) Space        - Scrap  + Sludge + Toxic Waste

## Implementation

This mod is heavily based upon MemoryStorage. It makes some very select modifications.
- "Memory Elements" are now referred to as "Toxic Waste."
- "Memory Units" are now Scrap Compactors and Sludge Condensers. Anything placed within will instantly become more waste.

## Hints

You have 4 techniques for dealing with Toxic Waste:
- Refine it into a more concentrated form.
- Store it in a Toxic Chest, cover it with Toxic Tomb, inject it into  water with a Toxic Injector or bury it in the earth with a Toxic Sequesterer.
- Release the pollution in a controlled way, using a Polluter or a Waste weapon
- A secret 4th strategy can be used to rid yourself of Toxic Waste, for a sky-high cost.

## Credits
Thanks to the devs of the Memory Storage mod, without whom this work would not be possible.
